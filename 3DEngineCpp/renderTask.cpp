// renderTask.cpp
//
// RenderTask tells the renderer what to render. The task payload is sent over the network to individual hardware nodes, which render frames
// according to the parameters in the task payload. Render tasks are also used to direct nodes to do things like load world data and adjust overall
// rendering parameters. The taskType attribute determines what kind of task is being sent.
